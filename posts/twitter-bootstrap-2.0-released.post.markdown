Bootstrap v2 has been released by Twitter and god it is sexy. I wasn't expecting a major release soo soon but it happen.
Version 2 builds of the same principals as version, including my personal favourite [LESS CSS](ttp://lesscss.com/) -
which I use on this site and many of my project.

I will admit, that despite sexy aesthetics and features so good I had thought of them, it doesn't seem to promote
creating your grid structure in LESS. I'm sure if you dig into the LESS that powers Bootstrap you'd be able to figure it
out for yo' self.

But I'd like to this opportunity to mention a great LESS grid framework: [Semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs).
Sematic.gs applies LESS realy well and remove all the span "soup" you get with regular grid frameworks.
