I've recently launched a small project called Redje. It's an attempt at porting [RegExr](http://gskinner.com/RegExr/) to HTML. The end product turned out quite well and it was a good chance to try out all the reading I've built it on [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) even though I only used the Backbone.View object.

Usage is pretty simple and straight-forward, if you spot any bugs feel free to contribute via [GitHub](http://github.com/cobbweb/Redje) or let me know on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/andrewcobby).
