The Global Mail has finally launched! It aims to bring a mosty unbiased, thought out and thoroughly researched journalism to the masses.
I'm am lucky enough to be apart of this great project as their in-house web developer.

I came on pretty late in the peice - less than a month before launch in fact - so I didn't get much of a change to sprinkle some of my UX foo on the site, nor biuld it. I have however been able to help the devs out of the last few days, mostly with frontend stuff. I was quite impressed with myself to setup the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>-powered website on my local machine, despite never even using python before!

As I write, the site has been up for nearly 24 hours and how a great response. There were of course a few haters, but we got enough chatter on Twitter to be trending in Australia for a couple of hours during the day. Admittely, a lot of the chatter on Twitter was about small bugs on the site which didn't get fixed before launch but these will be fixed over the next few days, all with some improvements.
