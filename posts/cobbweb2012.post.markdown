So you've finally landed on my new site. I've gone with a microblog-type approach this year in the hopes of actually posting frequently. It was also a good chance to try out some more [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)-foo. Overall I'm pretty happy with how it's turned out.

Posts are written in plain-text files and pushed via Git, then PHP spits these out as JSON and client/Backbone does the rest. The search function is pretty basic, simply asearching based on post tags and then titles. The source is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/cobbweb). Enjoy!
